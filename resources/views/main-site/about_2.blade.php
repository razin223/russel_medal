                To create a startup ecosystem and entrepreneurship culture in Bangladesh, the Innovation Design and Entrepreneurship Academy Project (iDEA) of Bangladesh Computer Council under ICT Division of the Government of the People's Republic of Bangladesh has been working since 2016. 
                </p>
                <p>
                iDEA Project has been playing a major role in promoting entrepreneurship as well as promoting startup culture in the IT sector in Bangladesh under the banner of Startup Bangladesh. We supporting the startups by providing grants, mentoring, training, co-working space and many more opportunities. We are working to help the future leaders of tomorrow through training and mentoring in the ICT sector and thereby take a step toward our dream of a Digital Bangladesh. 
                </p>
                <p>
                About 158 startups have been provided pre-seed grants through this project till now. Since its inception, the iDEA project has taken several initiatives through public-private partnerships with various educational institutions, including government and non-government organizations, and different international organizations. 
                </p>
                <p>
                To encourage young people, we have undertaken initiatives including “Student to Startups (Chapters 1 and 2)”, "National Hackathon on Frontier Technologies" with Tech Mahindra Limited of India, "ideaTHON" with South Korea, Startup World Cup and the implementation of IDTP. A fully government-owned public limited company called “Startup Bangladesh Limited” has also been formed to invest in seed/ growth/ guided startup companies on behalf of the government.
                </p>
                <p>
                Now, we are working towards one of our biggest global initiative - “Bangabandhu Innovation Grant (BIG)", which will be providing finding to 100 startups in honor of 100 years of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and his dream of living in a Digital Bangladesh. BIG is a platform for promoting local and foreign IT-based innovative product and service startups where university & stakeholder activation program plans have been made to organize with an international roadshow along with a TV reality show for the Birth Centenary of the father of the nation Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. 
                </p>
                <p>
                Last year, in recognition of its work, the project won an international award in the ICT Education category by The Asian-Oceanian Computing Industry Organization (ASOCIO), one of Asia's largest organizations in information technology in 2019. iDEA project also received international honors in the Public-Private Partnership category as runner-up of the "2020 WITSA Global ICT Excellence Awards" program organized on November 19, 2020 in Penang, Malaysia.
                </p>
                <p>
                Lastly, the iDEA project aims to establish Bangladesh as an IT-rich country by creating a well-organized startup ecosystem for local innovators and entrepreneurs, including the inclusion of youth in innovative cultures to make the country a member of the developed world by 2041.
